## What's new?

Improved some parts of the original website:

1. Set up the navbar component to be on top of the header component. That way we have a nicer layout and user experience.
2. Set up the header component`s content to have a smaller margin-top. User doesn't like to move his/her mouse all the way down to press a button or to lower his/her eyes to read the header text.
3. Changed the layout of components in the "Revolutionize Revenue Research with AutoGPT" component for better user experience. Switched from scroll bar to grid so you as a company would have users see all the components. But when we have a scroll bar, we are lowering chances for components to be seen.
