        <p>
          Finding new leads is hard (and expensive). Which is why we built R2D2
          from scratch with AI to help companies find more leads at a fraction
          of the cost.

        <h1 className="features-h1">Lead Enrichment in Real Time</h1>
        <p>
          By leveraging the latest AI technology like AutoGPT, R2D2 helps
          companies uncover more ways to connect with future customers in
          real-time.

        <p>
          R2D2 harnesses the power of several large language models (LLMâ€™s) to
          write personal & professional emails at scale.
